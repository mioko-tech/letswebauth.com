        <h5>Process overview</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>There are two key steps in the process - <span class="font-weight-bold">attestation</span> (creation and registration of credentials) and <span class="font-weight-bold">assertion</span> (authentication against existing credentials).</li>
            <li>Both steps required both front-end and back-end code to work successfully.</li>
            <li>The browser handles communication with the native operating system for user verification - that is, requesting the fingerprint or facial recognition.</li>
            <li>The browser will provide you with a public key credential that you need to store and verify against in future.</li>
        </ul>

See <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms" target="_blank">this list</a> for all available options.</li>
            <li>Specify the authenticators you prefer - e.g. <code>platform</code> for iOS and Android. Note that browser / OS may choose to ignore this.</li>

        <h5>Browser support</h5>
        <p>Web Authentication is widely supported on modern Android and iOS devices. See <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=webauthn" target="_blank">Can I use - Webauthn</a>, <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=credential-management" target="_blank">Can I use - Credenial Management</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API" target="_blank">MDN Browser compatibility</a> for more details on browser support.</p>
        <p>Important notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some browser support sites list functionality as fully supported (particularly from iOS 13.3) - however this is not the full picture, as only cross-platform <code>authenticatorAttachments</code> were supported - meaning external security keys. Platform authenticators - meaning use of the iPhone device itself as an authenticator - was only supported from iOS 14.</li>
            <li>Certain mobile vendors include their own browsers, such as the Samsung browser. We have not yet verified support in this browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>An easier way</h5>
        <p>If you are interested in trying out Web Authentication, the information and code samples on this site and others should give you plenty of direction to get started with. However, there is no doubt it is a complex process - in order to process the credentials your front-end will generate, you need complex server-side code to parse and verify them. However, there are tools available to help with this!</p>
        <p><a href="https://presence.mioko.tech" target="_blank">Presence</a> is a cloud tool that is offers a ready-made Web Authentication sandbox for use in your applications and prototypes. With this tool you will receive an API key which you can use to submit and verify credentials in minutes.</p>
